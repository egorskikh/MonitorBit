# MonitorBit

I am very happy with this project. I plan to develop it in the long term. I am constantly finding things that can be improved, and this makes me develop.

Stack:
- MVVM
- API
- Parsing JSON
- Core Data
- UIKit
- UITableView
- UICollectionView

## Add later

- [x] If there is no data, the results are not saved
- [x] Get rid of the storyboard entirely.
- [x] Design UI beautifully.
- [x] Fix code duplication in Core Data usage with Core Data Stack
- [x] Transition to MVVM architecture. The project turns into a massive-view-controller.
- [x] Show the current exchange rate when the button is pressed. The table will move down, and the current bitcoin rate will be visible.
- [ ] Add sorting by price (> && <).
- [ ] Start covering with tests
- [ ] Add a second view controller with the help of a tab bar on which there will be a graph of added prices.
